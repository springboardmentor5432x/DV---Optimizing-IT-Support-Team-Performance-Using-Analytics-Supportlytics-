#                                              Optimizing IT Support Team Performance Using Analytics ( Supportlytics)      
# Project Overview
      Supportlytics analyzes IT support ticket data to identify issue patterns, optimize resolution time, and evaluate support team performance using analytics and visualization.

# Milestone-wise Work
# Milestone 1: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
   - Loaded and explored raw ticket data
   - Selected only relevant columns for analysis
   - Converted start and end times to datetime format
   - Created key features:
       •Resolution_Hours
       •Priority_Score
   - Removed missing and invalid records
   - Saved a cleaned dataset for further analysis

 #  Output:
      Cleaned CSV dataset ready for analysis   

# Milestone 2: Exploratory Analysis & Clustering
   - Analyzed ticket distribution by:
       •Priority
       •Department
       •Ticket Type
   - Identified top issue categories using tags
   - Studied resolution time distribution
   - Applied TF-IDF for text vectorization
   - Used K-Means clustering to group similar issues
   - Evaluated clusters using size and similarity scores

  # Output:
      Visual insights
      Cluster-level understanding of issues

# Milestone 3: Performance & Geographic Insights
   - Compared resolution times across:
       •Priorities
       •Ticket types
       •Support teams
   - Identified high-priority slow-resolving tickets
   - Analyzed performance trends by country
   - Studied relationship between cluster size and performance

  # Output:
       Performance metrics
       Team and regional insights
