# DV - Optimizing IT Support Team Performance Using Analytics (Supportlytics)


## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes IT support ticket data to identify key performance trends, evaluate resolution times, and enhance operational efficiency through data analysis and visualization techniques. 

The goal is to uncover patterns in customer requests, technical issues, and support performance metrics to recommend improvements in workflow and resource allocation.

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Understand and preprocess IT support ticket data for analysis
- Explore trends in ticket volume, priority, resolution time, and category distribution
- Analyze agent performances and response efficiency
- Identify clusters of similar issues using similarity scores and clustering techniques
- Visualize performance metrics through dashboards and charts
- Provide actionable insights for IT support optimization
