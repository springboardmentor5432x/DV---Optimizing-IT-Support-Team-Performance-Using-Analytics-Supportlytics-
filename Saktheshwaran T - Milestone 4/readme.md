# 📊 Supportlytics – Milestone 4  
## Interactive Power BI Dashboard & Final Reporting  

---

## Objective

1. To integrate analytical insights from previous milestones into an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
2. To monitor IT support performance using structured KPIs.  
3. To visualize resolution trends, priority handling efficiency, and geographic performance.  
4. To provide a decision-support system for optimizing IT support operations.  
5. To present findings in a professional, business-ready reporting format.

## Dashboard Overview

Milestone 4 focuses on building a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates insights derived from:

- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Milestone 1)  
- Cluster & Similarity Analysis (Milestone 2)  
- Performance Trend & Geographic Insights (Milestone 3)  

The dashboard provides a centralized performance monitoring system for IT support teams.

## 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Ticket Count** – Overall workload handled (4000 tickets).  
- **Average Resolution Time (Hours)** – Overall service efficiency metric.  
- **Top Issue Category** – Most frequent technical issue type.  
- **High Priority Ticket Count** – Measures urgent workload exposure.  
- **Average Resolution Time (High Priority)** – SLA efficiency indicator.  
- **Top Performing Country** – Region with fastest average resolution time.

## 📊 Dashboard Components

### 🔹 Monthly Resolution Trend
- Line chart displaying average resolution duration by month.
- Identifies seasonal spikes and operational fluctuations.

### 🔹 Unresolved Tickets by Priority
- Bar chart showing backlog distribution across priority levels.
- Highlights SLA risk areas.

### 🔹 High Priority Tickets by Country
- Country-level comparison of closed vs unresolved high-priority tickets.
- Detects regional performance gaps.

### 🔹 Resolution Duration by Country & Ticket Type
- Stacked bar visualization of country-wise performance by issue type.
- Enables workload and efficiency comparison.

### 🔹 Cluster Size vs Performance Impact
- Scatter plot analyzing cluster size against average resolution time.
- Helps identify high-volume performance bottlenecks.

### 🔹 Geographic Performance Insights
- Choropleth map visualization for country-level resolution efficiency.
- Identifies high-performing and underperforming regions.
