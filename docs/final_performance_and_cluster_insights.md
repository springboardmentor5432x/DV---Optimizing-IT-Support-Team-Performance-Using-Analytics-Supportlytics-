# Final Performance & Cluster Insights

## Key Findings
- Worst performing cluster: Cluster 4
  - Size: 94 tickets
  - Avg resolution time: 8.81 hrs

- Best performing cluster: Cluster 5
  - Size: 167 tickets
  - Avg resolution time: 7.29 hrs

## Systemic Patterns
- Large clusters with high resolution time indicate repetitive issues
- These clusters cause sustained performance degradation

## Recommendations
- Automate or self-serve high-volume issue clusters
- Create dedicated resolution playbooks for slow clusters
- Proactively reduce ticket inflow by fixing root causes
