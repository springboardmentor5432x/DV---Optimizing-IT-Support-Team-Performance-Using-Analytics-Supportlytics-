# Performance Comparison Analysis

## Data Limitation
- The dataset does not contain explicit geographic information (Country/Region/Latitude/Longitude).
- Therefore, geographic performance comparison is not directly possible.
- An operational proxy dimension was used instead.

## Performance Dimension Used: `Product Purchased`

## Performance Extremes
- Worst performance: LG Washing Machine → 10.23 hrs
- Best performance: Amazon Kindle → 4.89 hrs

## Interpretation
- Groups with higher resolution times indicate support bottlenecks.
- These groups require priority attention for automation or process improvement.
