# 📊 Supportlytics -- Milestone 3

## Performance Trend Analysis & Geographic Insights

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objective

1.  To analyze IT support performance trends using resolution time and
    priority-based metrics and geographic analysis.
2.  To identify high-performing and underperforming countries/regions.
3.  To evaluate unresolved and high-priority ticket risks.
4.  To examine geographic distribution of issue categories using
    geo-analytics.
5.  To derive operational insights for performance optimization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

-   Average Resolution Time (Hours) -- Measures overall service efficiency.
-   Priority-wise Resolution Performance -- Evaluates handling of urgent tickets.
-   Country-wise Average Resolution Time -- Identifies regional efficiency differences.
-   Category Distribution by Region -- Highlights dominant technical
    issues geographically.

## Performance Trend Analysis

### 🔹 Average Resolution Time by Priority

-   Compared resolution duration across Low, Medium, and High priority
    tickets.
-   Identified whether urgent tickets are handled within optimal time
    limits.

### 🔹 Country-wise Performance Comparison

-   Calculated average resolution time per country.
-   Identified fastest and slowest performing regions.

### 🔹 High-Priority Risk Analysis

-   Filtered high-priority unresolved tickets.
-   Evaluated operational risk and SLA exposure.

### 🔹 Category-Level Performance Insights

-   Analyzed resolution time variation across issue categories.
-   Detected categories contributing to delays.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌍 Geographic Insights

### 🔹 Ticket Distribution by Country

-   Visualized ticket concentration using geo-mapping techniques.

### 🔹 Choropleth Map Analysis

-   Mapped country-wise resolution performance.
-   Identified regions with performance gaps.

### 🔹 Regional Issue Concentration

-   Evaluated which technical issue categories dominate specific
    regions.

# Analytical Summary

Milestone 3 focused on operational performance evaluation and geographic
intelligence.

Country-level analysis revealed regional efficiency variations,
indicating potential workload imbalance or resource allocation gaps.

High-priority ticket analysis highlighted areas requiring immediate
attention to reduce SLA risk.

Geospatial visualization enabled identification of performance clusters
across countries.

The insights derived in this milestone provide actionable direction for
process optimization and strategic resource distribution.
